Movie Sagas

Duration: 2 days

Getting the genre to populate was a challenge but once I figured out who to map to it was a lot easier. Also getting the drop down menu to populate with the genres was tough as well so I hard coded it and pushed it in and mapped through it. This may cause a slight issue if new genres are added though.


If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run a npm install,
Run npm run server in your terminal,
Run npm run client in your terminal,
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!


After running a npm install and server and client are running you can view the movies that are present on the database. Going to the Add page lets you add a new movie and fill in the info of the movie entered. You will need to fill all inputs otherwise you will get a pop up reminding you to fill the inputs. You can click each movie picture to view the details of the movie clicked. New features to come.
